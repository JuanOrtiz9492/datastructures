# PRIORITY QUEUE

A priority Queue works in a similar way of a Heap, however this is based on priorities,

a Queue could be based on a Max Bianry Heap, in such case the elements with highest priorities will be placed on top of the tree and will be
the first to be extracted

a Queue based on a Min Bianary Heap, the elements with lowes priority will be placed on top of the tree and will be the first elements to be extracted
