# BINARY HEAP

A binary heap is a type of tree that is very similar to a binary search tree. but the differences remains in how the data is organized

- Max binary heap: in a max binary heap the childrens must be smaller than the parent node 
- Min binary heap: in a min binary heap the childrens must be larger than the parent node

in a binary heap ther is no specific order, and in most cases is filled left to right and all levels must be filled before moving to the next one
